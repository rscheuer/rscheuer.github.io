      <h3>Essay</h3>
      
      <p>This semester for digital media has definitely been one of growth, both in and out of the classroom.  I started with little (recent) writing experience, having not taken any English courses in 2 semesters.  The initial writing assignments were brief, but succinct, and I wasn’t entirely upset with how they turned out.  The writing reflections ended up being the most helpful, as they forced me to explain how I felt internally and talk about myself.  This is something I don’t do often and it was actually somewhat of a challenge.  My first work in progress reflection was more about my work process, and I felt comfortable talking about technical details, especially for something that I am very passionate about.</p>
      
      <p>I would hope that the viewers/audience of my portfolio can see my design style shine through the mixed media that it contains.  While certain pieces of work, such as music and writings, make it harder for me to display my desired work style, I think that they might express a similar emotion.  I’ve mentioned this before but the soundscape was one of the hardest projects for me, and just thinking in sound in general is a huge challenge.  However, given my other work alongside it, I feel and hope that the audience gets the audio representation of some of my graphics.  Just to make a comparison, I think that my soundscape could be the new THX sound paired with my logo redesign.  If I were to do a full rebrand of THX, I would probably use a similar sound to my soundscape, if not twice as loud.</p>
      <p>In the same essence of changes, I think that my revision process has grown over the semester as well.  I still struggle with finding the best way to revise a written work.  I do enjoy writing, but returning to older writing is challenging for me.  I sometimes struggle to get into that initial mindset, and sometimes make changes that may stray from my initial goals in the piece.  For example, my bio on my website seemed to be clear enough from the beginning, and I played around with some changes.  I ultimately felt as if I couldn’t make it better by adding anything, so I just took some extra pieces out and changed some phrasing.  It wasn’t a drastic change, but it felt better to me.  Ultimately, I wanted my bio to be written for an employer or collaborator so I wanted everything to be personal and informal.  The changes I’ve made to this seem to reflect that.  For my graphic pieces, I made way more drastic changes.  I work quite fast in photoshop, and I love to make huge layout changes.  I payed close attention to the design concepts that we covered in class, and tried to make moves towards good design practices, even if the designs themselves were a bit “out there”.</p>
      <p>Peer review has made a huge impact in my development as a reader and writer.  I honestly have not been in a peer review class since freshman year, and I had forgotten how useful it is.  Reading others’ work is interesting to me on a content and personal level.  Being able to see different approaches to the same project is insightful.  Often times, I can get too wrapped up in my own thoughts, and seeing other people’s work for the same exact prompt gives me new ideas.  Also having people around me from different backgrounds being able to critique or collaborate with is refreshing.  It also gave me direct access to a broad audience, and being able to discuss my designs in and outside of class was helpful.  Same as with writing, I can sometimes get too set on my own train of thought and end up making something that only appeals to me.  While this can be good, for the purposes of digital media, it found it crucial to keep audience in mind.</p>
      <p>As I’ve said before, I wanted my work to tend towards brutalism, boldness, and experimentation.  I appreciated the affordances digital medium greatly for this, as it allows for more rapid changes and color experimentation than print media.  It is worth mentioning that I did initially intend my fonts to be exclusive to the web, but I have done some paper tests with a freelance poster design and the letter seemed to be quite readable from a distance.</p>  
      <p>One reading that very much influenced my style was the Low-Fi Manifesto by Stolley.  The idea of longevity and openness is important to me and I designed much of my work around accessibility in the long term.  My website design is almost entirely text based, and features no extraneous images.  The only major aesthetic change was the subtle font shift from the default serif font to a softer one.  However, there is a backup for the default, which goes in line with the Manifesto.  My previous site strayed heavily from this ideology and featured unnecessary scripts and images that distracted the viewer from the content.  Additionally, while this wasn’t my choice I appreciated the use of GitHub for managing our site.  Low-Fi manifesto encourages this: “All components of a digital work must be available for inspection, revision, and extension outside the scope of any one device, platform, or piece of production software and any one creator” (Stolley).  Everything I did in this class is now open to the world to view and critique, and I am grateful for that.</p>
      <p>My personal goals for this term in reading and writing were to pay more attention to detail, and become more comfortable writing in the first person.  I feel as if I have progressed in the reading area more than writing, and I realize that I have much work to do to become a better writer.  I honestly do want to continue to pursue writing, even if it’s just technical writing on Medium or some other self-publishing platform.  I’m proud of my skills assignment and the ways that I learned to get to where I am.  Soaking in hours of technical information can be mind-numbing, but I think that I achieved my goal of attention to detail.</p>
