      <h2>Skills Assignment</h2>
      <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
      <p>I had a lot of fun with this typography and design assignment.  I started out with an appreciation for typography, but very little understanding of the development process.  I initially looked to one of my favorite sites, typewolf.com for font pairing and color presentation research and went from there.  I also watched a good amount of Lynda videos about the app called Glyphs, which was crucial for font creation.  I realized early on that it is incredibly tedious to make a font in Glyphs, so I initially used a third-party vector drawing program called Sketch.  I knew this app pretty well so I didn’t need to watch any tutorials for this, and it definitely sped up my workflow.  Most of the practice during this assignment was done in Sketch.</p>
      
      <p>I knew from the beginning that I wanted to make my own typeface for the web.  It didn’t need to be highly functional or precise, but I wanted it to work.  I wanted to focus on this area because it is a huge part of communicative design, and I wholeheartedly believe that type can convey its own underlying message.  I’m obsessed by really aggressive and strange typefaces - ones that don’t conform to existing standards.  It’s too easy to blend in with the big names in type if you just make another high contrast serif or humanist sans font unless you essentially subtract from the shapes in unique ways.  I will say that I did experiment with subtracting vector points from existing fonts just as practice, and made a version of Times without serifs.  While this is fun, it isn’t exactly legal to use in print or web!  So I decided to go on a more experimental path.</p>
      
      <p>Most of my work was done in coffee shops around Pittsburgh, primarily Redhawk coffee.  Fueled by espresso, I sketched some initial ideas on paper.  For letter prompts, I used a site called typecooker.com.  This site will randomly give you letter “recipes”  for you to draw.  For example, it might list: Construction: Capitals, Contrast Type: Translation, Width: Extended, Stroke Endings, Straight, No Serif, Contrast Amount: High, Weight: Light. Personally, I love this recipe because it incorporates some of my favorite features and it gives me some freedom with height and style.  I used this site many times, even for really quick sketches in my notebook for fun.  It’s really unique and forced me to work outside of my comfort zone.  For example, I’m still really uncomfortable with drawing serif fonts.  The curved endings are nearly impossible for me to keep consistent.  Perhaps there is a tool that standardizes them (I know Glyphs has a programming layer), but I didn’t venture into this.  I did try my best to make some nice looking serifs on paper, but never got to digitizing them.</p>
      
      <p>One thing I’m really grateful for in this project is that I forced myself to learn Illustrator.  I’ve always had it on my computer, but I’ve sadly gotten too comfortable with Sketch and Photoshop that I never wanted to boot up Ai.  The first thing I realized about Illustrator is how different the hotkeys are.  Even when I changed them to the Photoshop bindings, the layers still behaved in unfamiliar ways to me.  This took quite a while to get over, and I still find myself copying back and forth into Sketch to achieve some quick bezier adjustments.  In my defense, the goal of this project wasn’t specifically Illustrator.  I do want to continue to use it, considering its use in the industry and its raw power compared to Sketch.</p>
      
      <p>The actual process of designing letters in Illustrator and Sketch was pretty straightforward, although a bit sloppy.  I set myself up with basic guides that I established after reading many medium.com articles about type.  Variables like ascenders, descenders, and x-height were all new to me, but they all make sense (the top part of a ‘b’, the bottom part of a ‘g’, and the height of the letter ‘x’).  These got me started with a consistent letter shape.  I ended up duplicating a lot of similar shaped letters in order to give myself perfect consistency.  The first 5 letters of the alphabet are great starting points for this reason (and just logically).  For some reason in my first font, I started on lowercase letters.  I was happy with the outcome, but for the next font I did the uppercase first.  I think that uppercase are much harder to make consistent, and if I establish a good theme for those, the other 26 letters will come much easier to me.</p>
      
      <p>Just to explain my techniques, in my first font I just drew vector paths for the letters and kept the stroke weight consistent.  This is similar to writing on paper, and it make the process very quick and easy.  This also meant that I didn’t need to “subtract” shapes to make holes in letters, since everything was just a path.  To make it into a font file though, I needed to convert everything from paths to shapes, so every straight line that was say, 10px thick and 100px long became a 10x100 pixel rectangle.  From the tutorials I’ve seen, most designers use exclusively fill shapes like this, but my technique worked in the first case.  In the second font I made, I wanted to go in a wildly different direction.  I started out with a single black rectangle, and subtracted shapes until it became the letter I wanted.  I was inspired by some old Swiss posters I found on an instagram account called The Letterform Archive.  My vision was a bold, punchy display typeface with very similar shapes.  Again, this is a pretty unconventional technique for type design, but I’m still getting into my stride and I’m happy with what I’ve made.</p>
      
      <p>Overall, I am extremely pleased with my personal growth as a type designer, going from a mere observer to a (somewhat) competent typographer.  My confidence in pen and paper sketching has increased, and I genuinely enjoy typecooker.com exercises.  I’ve been continuing to do them in my free time.  If I could start over but knowing what I know now (maybe this is cheating), I would try and make a really functional body font.  However, I know that this would be an endeavor that would occupy me for months.  I still have a bad relationship with Illustrator, and I hope one day remedy this.  Maybe if I started again, I would force myself to use exclusively Illustrator.  This might have fixed some of the errors in my font files.</p>
