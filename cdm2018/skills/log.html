      <h2>Reflection 2/23</h2>
      <p>So far I've been doing either research or practicing lettering on paper or digitally.  No actual font files have been made, but I've mocked up an uppercase alphabet.  I wouldn't say that my style is "professional" letters - they are actually really off balance, almost stretched.  I think I'll avoid body text for now, since my creations so far are impossible to read at small sizes.  Overall, I'm happy with my progress and I'm glad that I'm finally getting around to using illustrator.</p>
      
      <h2>Reflection 3/2</h2>
      <p>I've realized that font files are way more complex than just individual letter shapes.  A lot of spacing and measuring comes into play and make things actually more interesting.  I'm eyeballing almost everything, but keeping it visually consistent at the same time.  There is a lot of corruption that happens when converting from sketch files to the font itself and the font tools are much harder to master.</p>
