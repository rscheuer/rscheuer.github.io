      <h2>Work in Progress 1</h2>
      <p><b>Written Reflection</b></p>
      <p>So far in Composing Digital Media, I’ve tried to approach each assignment with a blank slate.  I’ve been doing web design for a very long time, but I really like how this class is focused on bare bones and essentials of design.  I’m not the most motivated writer, but I really like the assignments we do in class, and try to write them in ways that I’m not used to, but also in my own voice.</p>
      
      <p>For my site’s revision, I’ve adopted a slightly brutalist design, but stuck mostly to what I would consider minimal or utilitarian.  What I would consider “brutalist” would be the links, which disappear when they are hovered.  A lot of brutalist sites do this in more extreme ways than mine, but I like how mine looks when you take things away rather than add them.  I’ve added a serif font from google, but I’ve set it up so font size dynamically change with the window size, allowing for comfortable reading on all screen sizes.  I copied some of the design language from medium.com, a favorite blog site of mine.  All text is at 84% opacity and the main div fills up 80% of the view width, which I think looks pretty good on all screen sizes (both are techniques that Medium uses).</p>
      
      <p>My situation for this assignment might be unique, since I have built my own Github pages site a few semesters ago, so I initially thought that this would just be as easy as re-submitting what I already had.  However, I really enjoyed the process of rebuilding my site, and really just thinking about content and simplicity.  While my old site is built on bootstrap and does some things pretty well, my new site is pure, new code.  I actually ended up liking the new one a lot better, and after this class, I think I’m going to take out my old code and replace it.</p>
      
      <p>In this class, I have some design-based goals for the future.  I want to pursue a lot more experimental design patterns and font research.  To put them into specific objectives: I want to really learn how to manipulate CSS into box layouts that I can use on multiple screen sizes, I want to implement some sort of logo or icon for myself besides a simple letter R, and I want to make better mockups with pixel-level precision.  I consider myself at this point in my design career a jack of all trades, but a master of few.  I want to push myself to perfect a lot of my workflows and to just code more for fun.</p>
      
      <p>My areas of interest have always revolved around visual design and typography.  I obsess over font pairings and how different fonts look at different sizes.  I want to experiment more with implementing different font weights in the same text design, like how Paula Sher designs.  I’m also interested in vector graphics, and how I can use them on the web.  I want to get serious about css illustration for art purposes and just so I can become a master of CSS.</p>
      
      <p>I want my design work to go in a more experimental and brutalist direction.  I’ve always loved sites that are also works of art in themselves, like the early net art pieces that came out in the late 90s.  I want to take ideas from these and then use current tech to make beautiful but aggressive interactive motion graphics.  I’m not sure how much of this I can achieve in this course alone, but I’m willing to put forth as much work as I can now to achieve this.  I also want to dip my toes into the world of webVR and hopefully make some experience based web pages that I can host on github as well.  I want to research the new ways that people can interact with a piece of code online.</p>
      
      <p>Apart from design work, I want to get a deeper understanding of how the web works.  I have a good base of the “internet” from my telecommunications course, but as far as actually implementing them, I’m not very savvy.  I want to make complex web applications and things that can provide for large amounts of consumers, but that requires me to learn server-sided programs.  I want to become an expert in this are of web development in the hopes of becoming a full stack web developer.  I will continue to work using frameworks like Electron, and hopefully use them in CDM.</p>
      
      <p>I hope that I can continue to challenge myself to work in a more minimal and conscious way and simultaneously try new and bold design patterns.</p>
