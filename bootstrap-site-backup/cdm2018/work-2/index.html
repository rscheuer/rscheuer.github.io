      <h2>Work in Progress 2</h2>
      <p><b>Written Reflection</b></p>
      
      <p>For the visual aspects of this class, my process has been: brainstorm, create, revise many times, and then submit.  My photoshop project files are full of layer copies, each with small variations.  This is a technique that I have used since the beginning, and I think that it helps me track my changes.  This also allows me to switch back and forth to see what works and what doesn’t.  I have a specific style that I usually try to steer things towards which could be classified as brutalist.  What I really like is bold, aggressive designs that put information at the forefront.  Once the content or copy is established, I then experiment with a ton of color variants and effects.  I tend to distort and add filters, then subtract specific colors.  To me, this style feels lo-fi and human, even if the visuals are clearly very digitalized.</p>
      
      <p>The initial Thrill bottle advertisement design went down in this way.  Although I went though a lot of iterations to get it to where it was, I felt that it was missing something.  I wanted there to be an aspect of religion, especially since the original wording of the ad focused on “miracles”.  What the design lacked was a powerful religious figure to draw in consumers.  I settled on a comedic design that featured an image of Jesus and a consistent color scheme that is loosely based on the original advertisement.  I think that the new design, while definitely more busy, fits better into my desired aesthetic and overall design style.  It is even a bit more easy on the eyes, with more muted colors.</p>
      
      <p>In the case of the logo redesign, I didn’t use nearly as many effects, and went for a simple and clean 2 color design.  The company was THX, which used to have a very thin, sleek logo.  I liked the sleekness of it, and I like how it created a box within itself.  However, I thought that the size of the logo did not represent the actual noise that plays along with it in theaters, which is absurdly loud.  It scared me as a child, and my redesign features a very explicit description of said noise.  I also bumped up the thickness of the THX wording itself to represent the boldness of it’s sound.  Despite its simplicity, I still tried to implement my desired brutalist design system with incongruous font transformations and one of my favorite aggressive typefaces, Sharp Grotesk.  The whole design feels mean and in-your-face, and I’m pleased with the result.</p>
      
      <p>For the typeface skills project, I took a more stretched out approach.  Much of my initial research and practice was done with pen and paper, so it was easy to go over or correct mistakes, as well as iterate quickly.  This led to me being able to decide on a style direction within just a few pages.  From there I went right into Sketch, which is arguably even faster for iterating than photoshop.  The controls are essentially designed for rapid prototyping and that reflected my workflow.  For styles, I settled on an incongruous typeface with very little visual balance, but a consistent contrast.  I’ve seen some “funky” styled fonts in the past, but many of them featured a varied angle as well as varied contrast.  This style looks unstable to me, and my goal was always something that could actually function in some form of brutal design.  My second face was based entirely on one consistent sized rectangle.  I subtracted simple lines from each rectangle until a full alphabet was formed.  The only exception was the letter A and I which are angled differently.  I think that this face is completely in line with my brutalist vision, and I have used it in some projects outside of class successfully.</p>
      
      <p>For writing assignments, I honestly tend to go through less large-scale revisions, since unfortunately there isn’t a Photoshop for writing yet!  I approach them in chunks, focusing on specific, smaller goals until the entire piece comes together.  It takes a while, but I can eventually get into a sort of flow where I can write as I think, which helps.  After the base draft is done, I can then read through and take out bits that I don’t like or change wording.</p>
      
      <p>The assignment I had the most trouble with this semester was the soundscape.  I have used audacity, but I find it hard to layer things in a way that comes together nicely.  I also struggled with finding the right sounds, and ended up synthesizing some of them to create the noise I wanted.  I also felt that my soundscape was too basic, but I’m struggling to find a new direction to take it.  I hate to use the term, but I feel as if I’m just not a strong “aural learner”.  It’s just much harder for me to envision a completed soundscape than it is for some form of visual design.  I really do have interest in sound design, and I know that this is a skill area of mine that needs much improvement.</p>
      
      <p>My website is still very basic compared to my main github page, but the underlying code is all done by hand and I’m actually very proud of it.  I think that the contrasting background and text colors work better than plain black and white and are easier on the eyes.  My alignment is entirely left justified with 10 percent margins on both sides.  To me, it feels like a book or newspaper, and headers and body text is spaced out enough that nothing feels cluttered.  I tried to add a brutalist or aggressive touch by having links disappear when they are hovered over.  You mentioned my menu as being nontraditional, and I agree.  I think that small feature acts as an element of surprise or delight on an otherwise very familiar and comfortable site.</p>
      
      <p>Overall, I think that I have made strides towards my personal design direction of unexpected features, bold elements, and brutalist visuals.  Since this class started, I think that I’ve opened up photoshop for either a class project or personal design every day.  I want to continue to do this and push the boundaries of maximalist design and experimental typography.  I also want to continue to develop type for the web, and hopefully make something a little more traditional, possibly for website body text.</p>
